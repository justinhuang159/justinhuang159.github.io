Personal portfolio for photography

For my midterm I decided to make a portfolio for my photos. Some of the challenges was making the photo for my home page fit the screen. Another issue was the grid system for my galleries. I first used padding to space the photos out but I realized the percentages were a much better way of creating space. In order to create my website I implemented a header, footer, nav-bar, drop-down menu, and perhaps my favorite part was the contact form which sends a message to my e-mail via a service called formspree. My next steps would be to make my photos popup full screen if it were clicked on.
